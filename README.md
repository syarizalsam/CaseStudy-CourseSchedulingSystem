## Brief Description of Case Study
Course Scheduling system is an application that allow users to schedule courses for future semesters. Users will be able to add and drop courses from the application. It contains 25 empty course slots from Monday to Friday, which means 5 empty slots each day. The item is stored based on the course code. If the users want to add a course, they can click the  "Add a subject button", and then fill in the course code, course name, pick a day between Monday to Friday, and pick a time slot between 8.30am to 4.50pm, and finally save and it will be displayed.
